\chapter{RP11-D}
\section{Intro}
The RP11-D is the implementation of the RP11 disk controller inside
the QSIC and USIC.  The RP11 never existed on the QBUS at all and
we've extended it to support 22-bit addressing.

More than that, we've extended it further to allow for much larger
disks.  This is done by the simple expedient of allowing the sector,
head, and cylinder fields of the disk address to take on any value
that fits.  The result is 28 bits of linear block address or a maximum
disk size of $2^{37}$ bytes or 128GiBytes.  Obviously you'll need the
ability to modify your disk driver to take advantage of this.
