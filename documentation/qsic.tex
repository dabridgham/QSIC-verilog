\chapter{QBUS/Unibus Storage Interface Card}
\section{Intro}
The QSIC is a dual-height QBUS card that provides emulation of disk
controllers and disks using SD cards or USB disks as the storage
media.

The USIC is the same in a quad-height SPC card for the Unibus.  The
USIC also adds the Able ENABLE functionality in letting processors
with 18-bit addressing have access to $2^{22}$ bytes of memory like a
PDP-11/70.

Both cards have provision for adding indicator panels to display
internal state and functioning that invoke the feel of the older
machines.  They might even be useful for debugging from time to time.
