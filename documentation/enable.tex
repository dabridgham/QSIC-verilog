% Enable+ Programming Manual for the QSIC/USIC

\chapter{Enable+}

The Enable+ is an implementation of the Able ENABLE board inside the
USIC.  The ENABLE board gave access to $2^{22}$ bytes of main memory
much like the PDP-11/70 for processors that only had 18 bits of
addressing.

The Able ENABLE board worked by having three bus connections, one
UNIBUS coming in, one UNIBUS out, and a memory bus.  The USIC
simplifies this by having all memory on-board and doesn't actually
need a UNIBUS out.

There are two maps in the Enable+, one for accesses from the processor
and the other used when devices are doing DMA operations.
