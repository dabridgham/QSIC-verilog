 o Test that DMA cycles catch NXM
 o Implement DMA to I/O space (BS7)
 o Build a good testbech for exhaustively testing bus-arbitration and interrupt cycles.
 o Figure out the right thing for Q18 or Q16 configurations.
 o Consider moving RDIN and RDMGI to clock inputs.
 o Implement 4 transfers per bus acquisition.
 o Implement block mode DMA.
 o Restore RINIT reset to the RK11
 o check error returns when reading/writing SD card
 o optimize transfers to go directly when using QSIC memory (ENABLE+)
 o kick speed of SD card back up to 20MHz or even 25MHz
 o test that the RK11 handles NXM correctly
 o check for Disk Address overflow in RK11
 o make the RDY, RD, and WR lights for the RK05s on the RK11 indicator panel work better
 o BINIT is reset, BPOK inhibits accepting new commands, BDCOK will be a hard reset to the FPGA
 o Figure out how to disable the bus drivers until the FPGA is configured and running
 o look into using the Xilinx AXI crossbar between controllers and storage devices
 o remove FIFO from most storage devices, only SD writes need it.  redesign flow control
