= Indicator Panel

This is an attempt to replicate the functionality of DEC's indicator
panels used on PDP-11s and some other machines.  It was designed in
conjunction with the QSIC project to build a QBUS board to emulate the
old DEC disk drives using more modern storage technology and we wanted
to have blinkenlights to go with.
